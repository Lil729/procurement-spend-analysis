# Procurement Spend Dashboard

📊 This project simulates a real-world data analyst task: analyzing procurement spend to improve supplier performance, cut costs, and support business decisions. Built using Excel and Power BI.

---

### 🎯 Project Objective

Help procurement teams make better decisions by answering:
- Where is most of the money going?
- Who are our top suppliers?
- When is spending highest?
- Which categories and regions cost the most?

### 📂 About the Data

This dataset is adapted from the Superstore dataset (10,000+ rows), originally used for sales analysis. I repurposed it to simulate procurement spend by renaming key fields (e.g., “Customer Name” → “Supplier Name”, “Sales” → “Spend”).

Timeframe covered: **2014–2017**

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)
- Power BI (Power Query, Slicers, Visuals, Basic DAX)

---

### 🔍 Key Insights

- ✅ Top 5 suppliers account for over 65% of spend — concentration risk
- ✅ Spend spikes in Q4 — likely due to end-year procurement
- ✅ Technology leads all categories in cost
- ✅ West region shows the highest monthly variance in spend
